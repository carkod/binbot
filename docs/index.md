PLOTTING DOES NOT WORK WITH DEBUGGER

# algobin-notebook
Research Jupyter Notebook for algobin algorithmic trading

## To Develop

- Get list of crypto currencies in funds
- run sell algo with this list


- functionality on increasing intervals



## Concept
1. Filter:
    - Filter out coins > 10
    - Set BNB as the main market
    - Volume (to be determined)
2. Use volatility (Bollinger, Keltner channels) to determine change of trend
    - Higher volatility implies strength of move
    - Higher volatility implies trend as opposed to sideways move
    - Repeated green candlesticks surpassing top band
    
    
3. Reassure trend using DMI
4. Look for buy and sell signals with KST


## Sudden increase Algorithm

### A. Filters

Buy Filters:
0. Check positions (do I have BNB to buy?)
0. Monitor markets using ticker24:
1. Filter out coins > 10
1. > Certain volume 
1. Repeated green candlesticks surpassing top band => check it is not sideways move (DMI),
    if sideways move return false
    if trend checked return true
    
2. Check KST for buy signals. 
    if buy signal, check consistency in Bollinger/Keltner.
        if consistency fails return false
        if consistency true

3. Classify all TRUE (consistent coins) => choose highest potential increase
    for Algorithm testing, send emails
4. Buy 50% (for now)

### B. Orders

- Types of orders: limit order, market order, stop limit...  
    Need to make sure order executes
- Buy / sell order
